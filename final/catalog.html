They have a very special thing with flowers that no one really understands. They are commonly called "flower unicorns" because of it. They are the most similar unicorn to horses, by looks, and by having the faintest magical powers. They eat greens just like horses.</p>

		<p> Price: $60M<br> Shortly after the return of Light Magic, the luminous dragons were discovered high in the Berrywhite Mountains. An apprentice of the wizard Mohs was researching a rare geological formation of rock chalk and happened upon an aerie of the majestic dragons.</p>
		
		<h4>Chrome Dragon (Level: Super Rare)</h4>
		<img src="<img src="http://my-smashing.smashingapps.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Dragon-Artworks/dragon_34.jpg" alt="Jewel">" alt="Chrome">
		<p>Price: $50M<br> The chrome dragon is a vain dragon and has often been caught looking at its own reflection off of its shiny scales. Even though this dragon is extremely docile, it's probably best to approach it with caution. The sun's bright reflection has been known to start the occasional fire.</p>
		
		<h4>Obsidian Dragon (Level: Rare)</h4>
		<img src="<img src="http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/28200000/Dragon-dragons-28270304-700-525.jpg" alt="Obsidian">" alt="Chrome">

		<h4>Midnight Dragon (Level: Legendary)</h4>
		<img src="http://img.inspiringwallpapers.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Dragon-Wallpaper.jpg" alt="Midnight">
		<p> Price: $100M<br> The midnight dragon has been observed to stay up all hours to practice breathing its magical fire; the first dragon on record to be shown actually attempting to get better at this natural phenomenon.

The light this oil produces is soft and soothing - some have even claimed that the oil helps them to keep working effectively through the night</p>

		<img src="http://s1.picswalls.com/wallpapers/2014/01/29/dragon-hd-wallpaper_063723920_21.jpg" alt="Sea">
		<p>Price: $150M <br>An old tale from the Shimmering Isles describes a starry dragon that ferries travelers from one side of the sky to the other. It was long assumed that these stories were inspired by the Sorarian star, which traces a curvy path across the night, heedless of the other stars’ motions. With the coming of the Sorarian dragon, however, many have begun to wonder whether the subject of those stories was the star, or the dragon.</p>
		
		<h4>Aquamarine Dragon <Level: Super Rare></Level:></h4>
		<img src="http://yocreemipropiosite.weebly.com/uploads/3/8/0/5/38054539/1813159_orig.jpeg" alt="Aqua">
		<p>Price: $90M<br>Adrift in the Sea of Kimzar with no help in sight, the water wizard Koostow despaired that his latest magical experiment hadn't gone quite as he had planned. Much to his surprise, he was lifted from the icy waters on the back of an Aquamarine dragon and rescued. To return the favor, Koostow worked hard to make sure these dragons would be comfortable living on the Gemstone Island. Aquamarine dragons, like all gemstone dragons, cannot breed.</p>
		
		<h3>Others</h3>
		
		<h4>Griffins (Level: Common)</h4>
		<img src="http://i216.photobucket.com/albums/cc235/Fenris_Lunocracy/RealisticGriffin.jpg" alt="Griffin">
		<p>Price: $50M<br>Aelian said the wings of griffins were white and their necks were variegated in colour with blue feathers. The griffin claws were especially valuable as they were reputed to change color in the presence of poison, which is why they made useful drinking vessels.  At times, it is portrayed with a long snake-like tail. In some traditions, only the female has wings. Its nests are made of gold and its eggs resemble agates. It is supposed to be of gigantic proportions, the morphology being left to our own deduction after we have been informed that one claw is the size of a cow's horn. </p>

		<h4>Chimera (Level:Rare) </h4>
		<img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1374197-el_chimera_by_elshazam.jpg" alt="chimera">
		<p>Price: $80M<br> From the Greek meaning "she-goat" the Chimera is a fire-breathing creature that has the body of a goat, the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent.  Some sources have represented the Chimera with three heads (the lion's head as the main, then the goat's head sprouted from its back, and the serpent's or Dragon’s head on its tail), but the popular myth tells of the single, fire-vomiting head. The very unlikely aspect of the chimera has gradually turned its name into a synonym of a vain dream.</p>
		
		<h4>Phoenix (Level: Super Rare)</h4>
		<img src="http://www.tattoo.com/sites/default/files/field/image/tumblr_m4t5qvhwqx1r9jyoao1_1280.jpg" alt="Phoenix">
		<p> Price: $90M<br> Its name comes from the Greek word for "purple" because the phoenix is associated with fire and the sun. It has been described as golden or multicolored. Some say it never eats. Others say it eats only dew. Most believe there is only one of its kind and it lives alone in Arabia or Ethiopia. All agree it is a bird of great beauty. The Phoenix enjoys immortality, which had to be renewed with fire every 300 to 500 years. When the end of its life cycle drew near, the phoenix would gather aromatic herbs, woods, and spices from around the world with which to build its own funeral pyre or nest.</p>
		
		<h4>Hippocampus (Level: Super Rare)</h4>
		<img src="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/4218994-hippocampus-percy_jackson-sea_of_monsters-concept_art_by_sebastian_meyers-alt_design-.jpg" alt="SeaHorse">
		<p>Price: $100M <br> HIPPOKAMPOI (or Hippocamps) were the horses of the sea. They were depicted as composite creatures with the head and fore-parts of a horse and the serpentine tail of a fish. In mosaic art they were often covered with green scales and had fish-fin manes and appendages. The ancients believed they were the adult-form of the fish we call the "sea-horse". Hippokampoi were the mounts of Nereid nymphs and sea-gods, and Poseidon drove a chariot drawn by two or four of the beasts.</p>
