					<p> Price: $20M<br>Ruva is a fairly common type of unicorn that everyone seems to forget about These are some of the most classic unicorns--they come in mostly natural or pale, pastel-y colors, and live in meadows all across the world. They have a very special thing with flowers that no one really understands. They are commonly called "flower unicorns" because of it. They are the most similar unicorn to horses, by looks, and by having the faintest magical powers. They eat greens just like horses.</p>

					<p>Price: $20M<br> One good kind of unicorn is the magi-corns. Magi corns live in abandoned fields left behind by farmers and human tribes. They eat the grass and crops. They have the one of the most powerful magic powers when it comes into pairs. They use all of there powers for good and stick together in pairs of two. They do this because if for some reason they needed to make a huge wave of energy and magic to protect themselves, they could put there horns together and create the biggest pulse of power in the world!</p>

					<p>Price: $100M<br>There is one kind of unicorn that can fly, and it has wings and a horn. It is called a pegasus. They look like a normal bright unicorn only with wings. Their powers are to help all creatures. Whenever one of these unicorns is near you you will feel amazing! So if an animal of any kind is hurt or feels bad they will try to come by and help them to feel better. No one is exactly sure of where to find them, but they always seem to come save lives just when you need them!</p>

					<p> Price: $60M<br> Shortly after the return of Light Magic, the luminous dragons were discovered high in the Berrywhite Mountains. An apprentice of the wizard Mohs was researching a rare geological formation of rock chalk and happened upon an aerie of the majestic dragons.</p>

					<p>Price: $50M<br> The chrome dragon is a vain dragon and has often been caught looking at its own reflection off of its shiny scales. Even though this dragon is extremely docile, it's probably best to approach it with caution. The sun's bright reflection has been known to start the occasional fire.</p>

					<p> Price: $100M<br> The midnight dragon has been observed to stay up all hours to practice breathing its magical fire; the first dragon on record to be shown actually attempting to get better at this natural phenomenon. The magical breath temporarily leaves behind a rare and potent oil secreted only by midnight dragons. The light this oil produces is soft and soothing - some have even claimed that the oil helps them to keep working effectively through the night</p>

					<p>Price: $150M <br>An old tale from the Shimmering Isles describes a starry dragon that ferries travelers from one side of the sky to the other. It was long assumed that these stories were inspired by the Sorarian star, which traces a curvy path across the night, heedless of the other stars’ motions. With the coming of the Sorarian dragon, however, many have begun to wonder whether the subject of those stories was the star, or the dragon.</p>

					<p>Price: $90M<br>Adrift in the Sea of Kimzar with no help in sight, the water wizard Koostow despaired that his latest magical experiment hadn't gone quite as he had planned. Much to his surprise, he was lifted from the icy waters on the back of an Aquamarine dragon and rescued. To return the favor, Koostow worked hard to make sure these dragons would be comfortable living on the Gemstone Island. Aquamarine dragons, like all gemstone dragons, cannot breed.</p>

					<p>Price: $50M<br>Aelian said the wings of griffins were white and their necks were variegated in colour with blue feathers. The griffin claws were especially valuable as they were reputed to change color in the presence of poison, which is why they made useful drinking vessels.  At times, it is portrayed with a long snake-like tail. In some traditions, only the female has wings. Its nests are made of gold and its eggs resemble agates. It is supposed to be of gigantic proportions, the morphology being left to our own deduction after we have been informed that one claw is the size of a cow's horn. </p>

					<img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1374197-el_chimera_by_elshazam.jpg" alt="chimera">
					<p>Price: $80M<br> From the Greek meaning "she-goat" the Chimera is a fire-breathing creature that has the body of a goat, the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent.  Some sources have represented the Chimera with three heads (the lion's head as the main, then the goat's head sprouted from its back, and the serpent's or Dragon’s head on its tail), but the popular myth tells of the single, fire-vomiting head. The very unlikely aspect of the chimera has gradually turned its name into a synonym of a vain dream.</p>

					<img src="http://www.tattoo.com/sites/default/files/field/image/tumblr_m4t5qvhwqx1r9jyoao1_1280.jpg" alt="Phoenix" width="650" lenght="600">
					<p> Price: $90M<br> Its name comes from the Greek word for "purple" because the phoenix is associated with fire and the sun. It has been described as golden or multicolored. Some say it never eats. Others say it eats only dew. Most believe there is only one of its kind and it lives alone in Arabia or Ethiopia. All agree it is a bird of great beauty. The Phoenix enjoys immortality, which had to be renewed with fire every 300 to 500 years. When the end of its life cycle drew near, the phoenix would gather aromatic herbs, woods, and spices from around the world with which to build its own funeral pyre or nest.</p>

					<p>Price: $100M <br> HIPPOKAMPOI (or Hippocamps) were the horses of the sea. They were depicted as composite creatures with the head and fore-parts of a horse and the serpentine tail of a fish. In mosaic art they were often covered with green scales and had fish-fin manes and appendages. The ancients believed they were the adult-form of the fish we call the "sea-horse". Hippokampoi were the mounts of Nereid nymphs and sea-gods, and Poseidon drove a chariot drawn by two or four of the beasts.</p>

					<h4>Hellhound, Cerberus (Level: Legendary)</h4>
					<img src="http://ptkineticrace.org/sites/ptkineticrace.org/files/media/pictures/2014/cerberus-l.jpg" alt="Hellhound">
					<p>Price: $200M<br> They are said to have been created by demons to server as heralds of death. And this very notion makes them beyond terrifying, because they have no ability to reason with us – they are simply carrying out an order. After all they are animals – vicious, relentless and vile, but still an animal at its core. Abilities include seeing in the dark, controlling fire (hence they are fireproof) and being ghost-like invisible. With super strength, aggressiveness and speed, I doubt anyone can escape them. </p>

					<img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3437/3373217264_190f24e484_o_d.jpg" alt="Nine" width="650" lenght="550">
					<p>Price: $190M <br> Kitsune are from Japanese folklore and are Japanese foxes. A kitsune can have up to nine tails, depending on its age, wisdom and power. The only way to kill a kitsune is to cut off all of its tails, as it is said that one of the tails is its main tail and the source of all its power. Not knowing which tail is the main one, one would have to cut off all its tails to kill it.One, five, seven, and nine tails are the most common numbers in folk stories. When a kitsune gains its ninth tail, its fur becomes white or gold. A kitsune is a shapeshifter, and usually when it reaches the age of 100 years, it learn the ability to take on a human form. Thus, they have to be a fox for a hundred years before it can shapeshift from a fox to a human and back again. It is also said that a kitsune can duplicate other human beings, in other words shapeshift into the look-a-likes of different people. </p>

					<p>Price: $55M<br> The winged horse was also placed amongst the stars as a constellation, whose rising marked the arrival of the warmer weather of spring and seasonal rainstorms. As such he was often named thunderbolt-bearer of Zeus. In the constellation myths, Pegasos may have represented the blooming of spring whilst Khimairawas the cold chill of winter.</p>
